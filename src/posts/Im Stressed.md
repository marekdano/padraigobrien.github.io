Notes
- I'm tired a lot
- I have little motivation to engage or learn new things
- I do not know the direction my life is going in
- I live in my head a lot, i mean a lot, i have imaginary conversations with people at work in an attempt to ensure successfull outcomes
- When i dont get those outcomes i tend to get a tad depressed.
- I focus on diving deeping after a failed outcome to see if i double down 
- I worry if i am destroying peoples careers that work for me cause we are not doing our best
    - A colleague said to me recently that they are actually getting dumber while working here.
    - A colleague said to me recently that "whatever, as long as i get paid at the end of the month"

Journey so far
