## Hulacorn

I am researching a web service that allows you to pull in data from third party applications, like Jira, Github or anywhere that has a public API, normalise that data to a flat google sheet like interface, allow you to create rich visuals and alerts and share with your colleagues


### Recruitmenty

I am helping folk who need help getting that first job, or any job really, I provide free resume reviews and free mock interviews for anyone who wants it. The only ask, is that you help someone else when you are in a position to help them find a job.
